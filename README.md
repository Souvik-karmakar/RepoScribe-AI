# 🚀 RepoScribe AI

### Convert Any GitHub Repository into a Professional Blog Using AI Agents

RepoScribe AI is a multi-agent AI system that automatically converts any GitHub repository into a complete, long-form, professional blog article.

It reads the repository, understands the project structure, analyzes the codebase, and generates a clear human-readable explanation — ready to publish.

---

# 🌟 Project Overview

RepoScribe AI uses:

* 🧠 CrewAI (Multi-Agent Orchestration)
* 🤗 HuggingFace LLM (Mistral via LiteLLM)
* 🐙 GitHub API
* ⚡ Streamlit (Cloud Deployment)

This project demonstrates how AI agents can collaborate to automate technical content generation from raw source code.

# 🧍‍♂️ In Simple Terms (Layman Explanation)

Imagine you built a project and uploaded it to GitHub.

Now you want to:

* Write a blog post
* Explain it on LinkedIn
* Showcase it in your portfolio
* Help others understand your work

But writing detailed blogs takes time.

RepoScribe AI:

1. Reads your GitHub repository
2. Understands what the project does
3. Generates a complete professional blog
4. Makes it downloadable instantly

No manual writing required.

# 👨‍💻 In Technical Terms

RepoScribe AI:

* Connects to GitHub via API token
* Fetches relevant repository files (.py, .md, .txt)
* Prevents token overflow via controlled truncation
* Uses a multi-agent architecture:

  * Analyzer Agent → Understands project
  * Writer Agent → Generates full blog
* Uses HuggingFace LLM for inference
* Deploys publicly via Streamlit

---

# 🎯 Use Cases

This project is useful for:

* Developers
* Data Scientists
* ML Engineers
* Students
* Technical Writers
* Open-source contributors

### Real-World Applications

* Convert ML projects into publishable blogs
* Auto-generate documentation
* Create portfolio explanations instantly
* Explain complex repositories to beginners
* Build AI-powered content automation systems

# 🔄 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

## 1️⃣ User Inputs:

* HuggingFace API Key
* GitHub API Token
* GitHub Repository URL

## 2️⃣ Repository Fetching

* Connects securely to GitHub
* Reads only relevant files
* Excludes large notebooks
* Limits repository size to avoid token overflow

## 3️⃣ Multi-Agent Processing

### 🧠 Analyzer Agent

Understands:

* Project objective
* Tech stack
* Architecture
* Models used
* Business impact

### ✍️ Writer Agent

Generates:

* Introduction
* Problem Statement
* Dataset Overview
* Model Explanation
* Performance Metrics
* Business Insights
* Conclusion

## 4️⃣ LLM Processing

The HuggingFace model:

* Generates long-form readable content
* Produces plain text (no markdown)
* Provides a publish-ready article

## 5️⃣ Final Output

* Blog displayed in UI
* Downloadable as text
* Ready to publish

# 🔑 How to Generate GitHub API Token

1. Go to: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **Generate new token (Classic)**
3. Select:

   * `repo` (read access)
4. Generate token
5. Copy and use it in the app

⚠️ Keep your token private.

---

# 🤗 How to Generate HuggingFace API Key

1. Go to: [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Click **New Token**
3. Role: `Read`
4. Generate and copy the key
5. Use it in the app

---

# 🚀 Live Deployment

The application is deployed using **Streamlit Cloud**.

Users can access the public app and generate blogs directly using their own API keys.

---

# 🛡️ Security Design

* No `.env` file deployed
* No API keys stored
* User provides keys at runtime
* Repository content size is limited
* Notebook files excluded
* Token overflow prevention implemented

---

# 📦 Tech Stack

* Python
* CrewAI
* LiteLLM
* HuggingFace
* PyGithub
* Streamlit

---

# 🧪 Current Status: Prototype (MVP)

RepoScribe AI is currently a prototype demonstrating:

* Agentic AI architecture
* LLM orchestration
* Secure deployment design
* Token-safe processing

It is production-deployable but can be further scaled.

---

# 🌍 Production Vision

In production, RepoScribe AI can evolve into:

* SaaS documentation platform
* GitHub Marketplace App
* AI-powered DevRel assistant
* Auto technical blogging tool
* Portfolio automation system

Imagine:

* Every GitHub push generates a blog automatically
* Startups auto-generate technical articles
* Complex repositories explained for beginners instantly

* Mixtral 8x7B
* GPT-4-class models

### 🔥 2️⃣ Dedicated GPU Inference

* AWS EC2 GPU
* RunPod
* HuggingFace paid endpoints

### 🔥 3️⃣ Implement RAG (Vector Search)

* Chunk repository
* Generate embeddings
* Store in FAISS / Pinecone
* Retrieve relevant context dynamically

### 🔥 4️⃣ Parallel Agent Execution

* Map-reduce summarization
* Section-by-section blog generation

### 🔥 5️⃣ Caching Layer

* Redis
* DB storage
* Avoid repeated inference calls
